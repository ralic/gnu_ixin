NEWS for IXIN
See end for copying conditions.


- 1.1 | NOT YET RELEASED

  - included in dist: .sxml, .ixin files

	This is for the benefit of Guile 2-only users, and those who
	choose not to install Mixp.  If you modify foo.xml, however, you
	will still need Mixp (or a fixed a1-nf3-guile2) to update the
	foo.sxml (optionally) and foo.ixin (certainly) files.


- 1.0 | 2012-11-29
