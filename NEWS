  - included in dist: .sxml, .ixin files

	This is for the benefit of Guile 2-only users, and those who
	choose not to install Mixp.  If you modify foo.xml, however, you
	will still need Mixp (or a fixed a1-nf3-guile2) to update the
	foo.sxml (optionally) and foo.ixin (certainly) files.

  - bugfix: ‘(ice-9 pretty-print)’ fix applied more/less deeply

	Previously, the ‘string-xrep’ fix was applied only when the
	object to be output was directly a string.  Now, we intervene
	for any object (subverting ‘object->string’), to be able to
	handle two compound types, list and vector, which themselves may
	contain strings (and thus must be walked).  So much for the
	"more deeply" side.

	The "less deeply" comes from the incomplete (application
	specific) coverage of compound types.  Everything besides
	string, list or vector is still shunted to ‘object->string’.
	This imposes a maintenance burden: should programs one day wish
	to pretty-print other compound types that involve ‘write’ or
	‘object->string’ on strings internally, the subversion needs
	to be appropriately updated.

	Anyway, this bug manifested in the improper output of:

	  (punct (@ (end-of-sentence "no")) "…")

	under Guile 1.8.7 (mangled ‘U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSES’), and
	possibly other places, where the form's xrep fits on one line.
