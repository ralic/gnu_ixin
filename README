README for IXIN
See end for copying conditions.

* What is it?

  IXIN is an EXPERIMENTAL distribution of EXPERIMENTAL code and
  some pre-built IXIN files.  IXIN stands for "indexed texinfo".

  All code is under GPLv3+.  All (.xml) docs are under GFDL.

* Who is it for?

  The intended audience is Texinfo hackers and others who wish to
  build on Texinfo, adding to it the capability of producing files
  that are:

  - arbitrarily accessible
  - runtime configurable (e.g., paragraph indentation)

  See also:
  http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-system-discuss/
  http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/help-texinfo/

* What does it do?

  It defines a documentation file format and provides two simple
  tools to write and read, respectively, files in that format.
  The [[file format definition]] is described below.

* What does it NOT do?

  This package does not include a program to view documents in the
  new format.  You can do "make demo" to see some of the potential,
  though.

  Even more basic, it does NOT include the Texinfo DTD, which is
  expected under /usr/share (see [[file:zomg]] to manually tweak).

* dependencies

  The distribution includes pre-built .sxml and .ixin files, so the
  write tool is not necessary unless you modify the source .xml, in
  which case you will need to install Mixp (http://www.nongnu.org/mixp/)
  (Guile 1.8), or fix a1-nf3-guile2 (Guile 2.x), to proceed.  Of course,
  you need to have one of those Guile versions installed, too.

* file format definition

  In the following description, ‘(???)’ indicates points that are
  not very firm in the author's mind.

  Overall, the format is text (???), using UTF-8.  With the exception
  of the ‘meta’ portion, all SXML trees are third-normal form, w/
  abutting character-data sequences coalesced, attributes explicit
  in the tree's CADR, and in the "default" namespace defined in the
  Texinfo DTD, version 1.13, 2008/01/31.

*** magic: "ixin "

    The beginning of the file is five bytes (hex) 69, 78, 69, 6E, 20.

*** version

    The version number as a character string.  For now: "1".

*** coding (???)

    The coding system used for this file in the format:
    "; -*- coding: CODING -*-" followed by newline.

*** meta

    The list (ATTRS XID VARS SETTINGS COPYING TITLEPAGE ELEMENT...),
    that comprise the immediate children of the (input) ‘texinfo’ tree,
    truncated at the first ‘node’, and reformatted to make client access
    less tedious.  A newline ends the ‘meta’ portion.

***** attrs

      The SXML attributes sans ‘(@)’, usually: ‘((xml:lang "en"))’.

***** xid

      The list (FILENAME TITLE DIRCATEGORY), all elements strings.
      These are from the ‘setfilename’, ‘settitle’ and ‘dircategory’
      elements, respectively.  "XID" stands for "external identifiers".

***** vars

      The list ((NAME VALUE)...), from ‘setvalue’ elements.  NAME is a
      symbol, and VALUE is a string.

***** settings

      The list ((NAME VALUE)...), reserved for ‘@paragraphindent’ et al.
      NAME is a symbol, VALUE type depends on NAME.

      This element is "reserved" because at time of writing, makeinfo
      does not actually write any such information to the XML file.

***** copying

      The SXML '(copying (@) (para ...)...)', which contains the Texinfo
      ‘@copying’ block.

***** titlepage

      The SXML-ish (???) element ‘titlepage’.  If the original Texinfo
      contains ‘@insertcopying’, this has the form:

      (titlepage (@ (copying "copying"))
        ...
        "@insertcopying"
        ...)

      Otherwise, it has the form:

      (titlepage (@)
        ...)

      That is, there is no ‘copying’ attribute, and no "@insertcopying".
      The "-ish" is because we're not sure how valid a naked string is.

***** element...

      These are the rest of the elements after ‘titlepage’ but before
      the first ‘node’.  Usually: ‘((contents (@)))’.

*** counts

    The list (INDEX-LENGTH COUNT TOP TLI).

    INDEX-LENGTH is the byte-length of the index (described below).

    COUNT is the total number of nodes.

    TOP is the 0-based index of the ‘Top’ node, or -1 if there is no
    such node..

    TLI is an alist with symbolic key TYPE (such as ‘cp’ or ‘fn’),
    and value (INDEX...), where each INDEX is the index of a node
    containing a ‘printindex’ element.  "TLI" is for "two-letter"
    named index, which is what the Texinfo docs use.

    A newline ends the ‘counts’ portion.

*** index

    A series of COUNT lists of the form (NAME LENGTH NEXT PREV UP),
    each followed by newline.

    NAME is a string, e.g., "Top".  This is the only "direct string"
    in the file format and the reason that we need to specify coding.

    LENGTH is an integer, the number of bytes required to read the
    raw "node data" (described below).

    NEXT, PREV, and UP are integers, pointing to other members of the
    index.  A value of -1 indicates a missing component (e.g., UP and
    PREV for "Top" is typically -1).

*** node data

    This is a series of COUNT ‘node’ element forms, each gzipped,
    base64-encoded (???), and followed by newline.

    The order is the same as in the index portion of the file.

* possible access patterns

  The retrieve program illustrates one access pattern: read up
  through the index, and then use that information to dig out node
  data on demand.

  Another one, which optimizes for size and speed, is to use
  INDEX-LENGTH and the file position after reading the ‘counts’
  portion to compute the "base" of the node data, then read up
  through the "Top" index entry (typically the first).  This way,
  both subsequent index entries as well as data can be accessed on
  demand.

* invoking a1-nf3-{mixp,guile2}

  Usage: a1-nf3-{mixp,guile2} FILENAME

  Display the XML file in "SXML format" to stdout.

  FILENAME should be produced by "makeinfo --xml".

* invoking a2ixin

  Usage: a2ixin FILENAME

  If FILENAME ends with ".sxml", create STEM.ixin, where STEM is the
  basename of FILENAME.  If FILENAME ends with ".xml" invoke one of
  the a1-nf3-* programs to internally convert it to "SXML format" first.

* invoking retrieve

  Usage: retrieve IXIN [COMMAND [ARGS...]]

  IXIN is the name of a file created by a2ixin.

  COMMAND (and args) is one of the following:

  - dump
  - dump/abbrev COLUMNS
  - dump-meta
  - dump-counts
  - dump-index
  - dump-node
  - show-node WHICH
  - show-all-nodes
  - repl END-CODE

  WHICH can be a name, like "Top", or a number, like "0".
  If no COMMAND is specified, it is taken as "dump/abbrev 42".

  For ‘repl’, END-CODE is a decimal number that specifies the first
  character in the two character sequence used to terminate a response.
  The second char is always newline (aka ‘\n’).  For example, use 12 for
  formfeed (aka, ‘\f’).

  In ‘repl’ mode, retrieve maintains a "current node", initially id 0
  (name "Top"), and loops reading a line from stdin and displaying
  results to stdout.  Valid commands (and args) are:

  - where        -- display current node information
  - nav          -- display next/prev/up links (subset of ‘where’)
  - next         -- move to ‘next’ node, if possible
  - prev         -- move to ‘prev’ node, if possible
  - up           -- move to ‘up’ node, if possible
  - goto WHICH   -- jump directly to node WHICH
  - show [WHICH] -- do ‘show-node’ for WHICH or current node
  - raw [WHICH]  -- do ‘dump-node’ for WHICH or current node
  - dump-meta    -- as from command-line (above)
  - dump-index   -- as from command-line (above)
  - quit         -- exit immediately

* What needs to be done, still?

  - write ixin.el that uses it
  - w/ upstream (Texinfo) hackers:
    - discuss what is missing
      - actual entries in the indices
      - macros (maybe i'm missing something?)
      - images, etc
    - work towards v2
  - fix a1-nf3-guile2
  - (depending on viability) clean up impl

* implementation notes

*** generally

    The gzip/base64 temp-file interaction is quick (to write) and dirty.
    Kids, laugh all you want, but don't do this in your own code!

*** a2ixin

    The ‘(node ...)’ form is not identical to the input SXML;
    [[file:a2ixin::xnode!][xnode!]] removes the element by side-effect.

    The upshot is to move name, next, prev and up elements (actually,
    their decoded (and re-encoded, for the links) contents) into the
    index.

    This is the only non-functional (destructive) operation on the nodes.

*** retrieve

    The many "~Y" in the format strings (instead of simpler "~S") forces
    control through ‘string-xrep’ ([[file:z-fixed-pp.scm]]).  Surprisingly,
    this is necessary even for Guile 2.  Hmmm.
